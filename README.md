### Project Objective
This project is aimed to briefly explain the above sub- topics listed in the Project Overview.

### Introduction

Data Analysis involves inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data to discoer useful information, draw conclusions and support decision making.


### Project Body
#### Foundations of Data

 DATA LITERACY
 
- Data Generation: This deals with how data is set and ways to store data which can be done on;
  1. premises i.e within the wall of an organization e.g Excel
  2. In the Cloud i.e Data centre e.g Microsoft Oracle
- Data Structure: This is divided into three, which are;
  1. Structured i.e in a tabular format
  2. Semi Structured e.g JASON, XML format
  3. Unstructured i.e media files e.g data on video
- Data Centre Storage; Microsoft, Amazon
- Data Analysis Life cycle
  1. Ingestion
  2. Transformation
  3. Modelling
  4. Visualization
  5. Analysis
  6. Presentation
 
#### Importance of Data Analysis
- It helps the organizaation to make decisions based on actual data rather than intuition or guess work.
- It helps to identifies bottlenecks and inefficiencies in processes leading to optimization and cost reduction.
- It helps in better allocation of resources based on data insights, maximizing productivity.
- It helps to predicts future trends and outcomes, allowing business to prepare and strategize accordingly.
- It helps to identifies new opportunities for product and serice innovation through analysis of market and consumer data

#### Skills required for Data Analysis
- Technical skill
  1. Python
  2. Excel
  3. R Language
  4. SQL
- Data Visualization
  1. Tableau
  2. Power BI
- Critical Thinking
- Data wrangling and cleaning
- Communication skills

#### Career paths in Data Analysis
