### Project Overview
This Project covers the foundations of Data, Data generationn, Data Structure, Data Analysis life cycle, Importance of Data Analysis, Skills required for Data Analysis and Career paths in Data Analysis.

### Project Objective
This project is aimed to briefly explain the above sub- topics listed in the Project Overview.

### Introduction
- Data Analysis inovoles inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data to discoer useful information, draw conclusions and support decision making.
### Project Body
#### Foundations of Data
- Data Literacy
- Data Generation: This deals with how data is set and ways to store data which can be done on;
  1. premises i.e within the wall of an organization e.g Excel
  2. In the Cloud i.e Data centre e.g Microsoft Oracle
- Data Structure: This is divided into three, which are;
  1. Structured i.e in a tabular format
  2. Semi Structured e.g JASON, XML format
  3. Unstructured i.e media files e.g data on video
- Data Centre Storage; Microsoft, Amazon
- Data Analysis Life cycle
  1. Ingestion
  2. Transformation
  3. Modelling
  4. Visualization
  5. Analysis
  6. Presentation
 
#### Importance of Data Analysis
- It helps the organizaation to make decisions based on actual data rather than intuition or guess work.
- It helps to identifies bottlenecks and inefficiencies in processes leading to optimization and cost reduction.
- It helps in better allocation of resources based on data insights, maximizing productivity.
- It helps to predicts future trends and outcomes, allowing business to prepare and strategize accordingly.
- It helps to identifies new opportunities for product and serice innovation through analysis of market and consumer data

### Conclusion

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

### Data Analysis

``` SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
